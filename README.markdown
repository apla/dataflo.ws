workflow processing for node.js
===============================

abstract
-------------------------------

every application is based on series of workflows. if your workflow is written
in a program code, you have a problem. people don't want to screw up, but
they do. `workflow.nodejs` is an abstract async processing framework for
describing workflows in simple configuration.

you can use workflow for description of programmatic workflows. or
real life ones.

add DSL by your own taste.

concept
-------------------------------

this project concept is born combining [flow based paradigm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) and
[responsibility driven design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility-driven_design).

typically, workflow.nodejs designed to be used in client-server applications.
external system (client) make request and initiator receive this request.
after parsing request, initiator make decision which workflow is responsible by
this type of request. when decision is made and workflow is found, initiator start
workflow. workflow is based on series of tasks. tasks have input parameters and
may have response value. tasks doesn't talk one-to-one; instead, output
from task delivered to workflow (controlling routine) via event data (message);
input parameters provided by passing parameters from workflow.

thus, tasks have [loose coupling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_science))
and can be [distributed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_data_flow).

tasks must be designed [functionally cohesed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science))
in mind, which leads to a good system design.

terms
------------------------------

### initiator ###

it's an entry point generator. every workflow has one entry point
from one initiator.

for example, initiator can be a http daemon, an amqp listener,
a file system event (file changed), a process signal handler,
a timer or any other external thing.

### entry point ###

it's a trigger for specific workflow. each initiator has its own entry point
description.

for example, entry point for a httpd daemon is an url. httpd may have a simple
url match config or a complex route configuration â€” you decide which initiator
does handling requests.

### workflow ###

a set of tasks, which leads workflow to success or fail

### task ###

a black processing cube.

every `task` has its own requirements. requirements can be `entry point` data (for
example, query string in case of httpd `initiator`) or another `task` data.
if requirements satisfied, `task` start to execute. after execution `task`
produce dataset.

real life example
-------------------------------

you want to visit a conference. your company doing all dirty work for you. but,
you must make some bureocratic things.

1.   receive an approve from your boss.
2.   waiting all the needed documents for conference (foreign visa, travel tickets,
hotel booking, conference fee pay)
3.   get an travel allowance
4.   visit conference and make report for finance department (hotel invoice,
airline tickets, taxi receipt and so on)
5.   make a presentation about conference

then tasks looks like:

	conferenceRequest   (
		conferenceInfo
	) -> approve

after approve we can book a hotel

	hotelBookingRequest (
		approve
	) -> hotelBooking

documents for visa must already contain conference info and booking

	visaRequest (
		approve, conferenceInfo, hotelBooking
	) -> visa

we pay for conference and tickets after visa has done

	conferenceFeePay (
		approve, visa
	) -> conferenceFee

	ticketsPay (
		approve, visa
	) -> tickets



synopsis
-------------------------------


	var httpd  = require ('initiator/http');

	var httpdConfig = {
		"workflows": [{
			"url": "/save",
			"tasks": [{
				"className": "post",
				"request": "{$request}",
				"produce": "data.body"
			}, {
				"className": "render",
				"type": "json",
				"data": "{$data.body}",
				"output": "{$response}"
			}]		
		}, {
			"url": "/entity/tickets/list.json",
			"tasks": [{
				"className":  "mongoRequest",
				"connector":  "mongo",
				"collection": "messages",
				"produce":    "data.filter"
			}, {
				"className": "render",
				"type": "json",
				"data": "{$data.filter}",
				"output": "{$response}"
			}]
		}]
	};

	var initiator = new httpd (httpdConfig);



implementation details
-----------------------

### initiator ###

initiator make an request object, which contains all basic info about request. basic info means you didn't receive all the data, but you get everything to fetch complete request data.

example: using httpd initiator, you receive all GET data i.e. query string, but in case POST request, you'll need to receive all post data by yourself (using task within workflow)

### task ###

every task has its own state and requirements. all task states:

*   scarce - starting task state
*   ready - task ready to run (when all task requirements satisfied)
*   running - workflow decided to launch this task
*   idle - not implemented
*   completed - task completed without errors
*   error - task completed with errors
*   skipped - task skipped, because other execution branch is selected (see below)


### workflow ###

workflow check for task requirements and switch task state to ready. if any available running slots available, workflow start to run task.


how to write your own task
--------------------------

assume we have task for checking file stats

first of all, we need to load task base class along with fs node module:

	var task         = require ('task/base'),
		fs           = require ('fs');

next, we need to write constructor of our class. constructor receive all of task parameters and must call this.init (config) after all preparations.

	var statTask = module.exports = function (config) {
		this.path = config.path;
		this.init (config);
	};

next, we inherit task base class and add some methods to our stat class:

	util.inherits (statTask, task);

	util.extend (statTask.prototype, {
		
		run: function () {

			var self = this;
			
			fs.stat (self.path, function (err, stats) {
				if (err) {
					self.emit ('warn', 'stat error for: ' + self.path);
					self.failed (err);
					return;
				}
				
				self.emit ('log', 'stat done for: ' + self.path);
				self.completed (stats);
			})
		}
		
	});

in code above i've used this methods:

*   emit - emit message to subscriber
*   failed - method for indication of failed task
*   completed - mark task as completed successfully

open source licensing
---------------------------

you can use workflow framework if your application is compatible with
GPLv3 licensing terms. most important thing about this license is that
you must provide source code of your application for your users so they can
modify contents of your application for their own needs.

commercial licensing
---------------------------

there is no fixed commercial licensing for this framework, it depends on
