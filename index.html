      workflow processing for javascript

abstract

every application is based on series of workflows. if your workflow is written in a program code, you have a problem. people don't want to screw up, but they do. workflow.nodejs is an abstract async processing framework for describing workflows in simple configuration.

you can use a workflow for description of programmatic workflows. or real life ones.

add DSL by your own taste.

concept

this project concept is born combining flow based paradigm and responsibility driven design.

typically, the workflow.nodejs is designed for usage in client-server applications. an external system (client) makes request and an initiator receives this request. after parsing request, an initiator makes decision which workflow is responsible for this type of request. when decision is made and a workflow is found, an initiator starts a workflow. a workflow is based on series of tasks. tasks have input parameters and may have a response value. tasks don't talk one-to-one; instead, output from a task is delivered to a workflow (a controlling routine) via event data (a message); input parameters provided by passing parameters from workflow.

thus, tasks have loose coupling) and can be distributed.

tasks must be designed functionally cohesed) in mind, which leads to a good system design.

terms

initiator

it's an entry point generator. every workflow has one entry point from one initiator.

for example, initiator can be a http daemon, an amqp listener, a file system event (file changed), a process signal handler, a timer or any other external thing.

entry point

it's a trigger for a specific workflow. each initiator has its own entry point description.

for example, an entry point for a httpd daemon is an url. httpd may have a simple url match config or a complex route configuration â€” you decide which initiator handles requests.

workflow

a set of tasks, which leads workflow to success or fail

task

a black processing cube.

every task has its own requirements. requirements can be an entry point data (for example, a query string in case of httpd initiator) or another task data. if requirements are met, the task starts execution. after execution the task produces a dataset.

real life example

you want to visit a conference. your company does all dirty bureaucratic work for you. but, you must make some bureocratic things too.

receive approval from your boss.
wait for all the needed documents for the conference (foreign visa, travel tickets, hotel booking, the conference fee pay)
get travel allowance
visit the conference and make a report for finance department (a hotel invoice, airline tickets, a taxi receipt and so on)
make a presentation about the conference
then tasks look like:

conferenceRequest   (
    conferenceInfo
) -> approve
after approval we can book a hotel

hotelBookingRequest (
    approve
) -> hotelBooking
documents for visa must already contain conference info and booking

visaRequest (
    approve, conferenceInfo, hotelBooking
) -> visa
we pay for the conference and tickets after the visa is received

conferenceFeePay (
    approve, visa
) -> conferenceFee

ticketsPay (
    approve, visa
) -> tickets
synopsis

var httpd  = require ('initiator/http');

var httpdConfig = {
    "workflows": [{
        "url": "/save",
        "tasks": [{
            "className": "post",
            "request": "{$request}",
            "produce": "data.body"
        }, {
            "className": "render",
            "type": "json",
            "data": "{$data.body}",
            "output": "{$response}"
        }]      
    }, {
        "url": "/entity/tickets/list.json",
        "tasks": [{
            "className":  "mongoRequest",
            "connector":  "mongo",
            "collection": "messages",
            "produce":    "data.filter"
        }, {
            "className": "render",
            "type": "json",
            "data": "{$data.filter}",
            "output": "{$response}"
        }]
    }]
};

var initiator = new httpd (httpdConfig);
implementation details

initiator

an initiator makes a request object, which contains all basic info about particular request. the basic info doesn't mean you received all the data, but everything required to complete the request data.

example: using a httpd initiator, you receive all GET data i.e. a query string, but in case of a POST request, you'll need to receive all the POST data by yourself (using a task within a workflow)

task

every task has its own state and requirements. all task states:

scarce - the task is in initial state; not enough data to fulfill requirements
ready - task is ready to run (when all task requirements are met)
running - a workflow has decided to launch this task
idle - not implemented
completed - the task completed without errors
error - the task completed with errors
skipped - the task is skipped, because another execution branch is selected (see below)
workflow

the workflow checks for task requirements and switches task state to ready. if any running slots are available, the workflow starts task exectution.

how to write your own task

assume we have a task for checking file stats

first of all, we need to load a task base class along with fs node module:

var task         = require ('task/base'),
    fs           = require ('fs');
next, we need to write a constructor of our class. a constructor receives all of task parameters and must call this.init (config) after all preparations.

var statTask = module.exports = function (config) {
    this.path = config.path;
    this.init (config);
};
next, we inherit task base class and add some methods to our stat class:

util.inherits (statTask, task);

util.extend (statTask.prototype, {

    run: function () {

        var self = this;

        fs.stat (self.path, function (err, stats) {
            if (err) {
                self.emit ('warn', 'stat error for: ' + self.path);
                self.failed (err);
                return;
            }

            self.emit ('log', 'stat done for: ' + self.path);
            self.completed (stats);
        })
    }

});
in code above i've used these methods:

emit - emits message to subscriber
failed - a method for indication of the failed task
completed - marks the task as completed successfully</p>
